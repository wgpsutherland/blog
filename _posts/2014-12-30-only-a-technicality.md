title: Only a technicality.
---

I've started to realise that I get the most reward out of my work when I solve something very technical.
Creating new features is nice, but if it's all simple, boilerplate stuff then I don't feel much when I finish it, just a slight satisfaction that I can close off another GitHub issue.
If it's taken me hours with my nose pressed up against the screen however, the feeling is much better.

This may seem obvious - something more difficult feels more rewarding when it's completed - but I think its a good thing to keep in mind.

*I must keep challening myself.*

Today I finally got rid of the hard coded admin check that allowed only me (user #1) to access the admin page in *Gradients*.
Now I can make anyone an admin, where they will instantly have access to the secret page and the option will immediately appear in their navigation bar.
I had to completely restructure the router for this to work, but it was very much worth it.

Yesterday I was just working on input forms, and it was *boring*.

Sometimes working on stuff that is purely behind the scenes is much more fun than working on the pretty front end.
It just *feels* more clever.

The problem with this is I've now found so many things I want to refactor and tinker with. 
I guess it's a vicious cycle.
