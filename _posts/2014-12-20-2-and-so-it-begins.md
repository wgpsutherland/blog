title: And so it begins.
---

I made a little sprite drawing last night.
It is very much in the art style of *Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP*.
For the moment it's the style I'm going to follow, who knows where it will end up!

<br><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/first_sprite.png" alt="A Sprite drawing of a man on a hill" class="small-blog-image">

I've got to be honest, drawing this image was very fun. I feel that I am going to be able to be very expressive with this style, even though there is not much detail. I can't wait.
