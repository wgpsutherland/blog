title: Haskell is now my life.
---

I ordered the second Jordan Mechner book today, this one actually being about *Prince of Persia*. 
Reading his process on the entire development of a game whilst it's happening is fascinating, and is very different from other books I've read that rely on 
past recollection and a bit of exaggeration.

Haskell is now my life (at least for the next week).
I'm loving it however, so it's not bad, just I'm not entirely sure how I'm meant to go about creating a design document. I'm pretty sure I should be following it,
not writing it afterwards...

I've been listening to soundtracks recently - music with lyrics is too distracting, and I feel I need something to pull me into the zone. 
The three Lord of the Rings soundtracks have been a godsend, though I'm trying to branch out and listen to others - it would horrifiy me to realise that I'd listened 
to LOTR so much that I'm now sick of it.

*The Dark Knight*, *Batman Begins* and *Inception*. Three good soundtracks to listen to, though things do get a little intense.

I want to go to my Hockey Christmas Day tomororow, but I don't think it's going to be possible if I want to get this assignment done as well as I think I can.
It's a shame, as it was one of the best days of the year last year.
