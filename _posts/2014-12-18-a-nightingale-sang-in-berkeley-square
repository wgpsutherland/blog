title: A Nightingale Sang In Berkeley Square.
---

I spent all of yesterday listening to John Williams, going into the early hours of this morning where I sit now.
It's as if Spotify knows what time it is - as it's gotten later it has started to play the score to *The Terminal*, a light, relaxing soundtrack that at one point alluded to *A Nightingale Sang In Berkeley Square*. 

It reminds me of Rod Stewart and home.
