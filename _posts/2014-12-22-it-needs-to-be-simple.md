title: It needs to be simple.
---

I need to start simple. 
I can't go right into making this extraordinarily complex game, as I'll just burn out and never finish the thing.
A simple puzzle game with the art direction I want is the way to go.
Something like *Q\*bert* would work nicely, a simple level based puzzler.

I need to work out what perspective to use.
*Q\*bert* was made using an isomteric view, but the art style I want doesn't lend itself to that well, the diagonals look too ugly.
This needs more thought.
