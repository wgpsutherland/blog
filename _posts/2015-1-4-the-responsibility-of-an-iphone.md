title: The responsibility of an iPhone.
---

So I bought an iPhone 6 yesterday.
I'm just in love with it.
Not only do I not have to use accessbility features to turn the damn thing off anymore, I am a huge fan of the bigger screen.
And it's gold.

Playing around in the Apple Store buying the case for it prompted me to try out *Gradients* on an iPad.
It looked *okay*, but I wasn't a fan of how all the module and grades were just stacking on top of each other, so I've rewritten the templates to look better on mobile.

It now looks great, especially on my phone.
There are some small fixes I need to work on, but I'm much happier showing the site to people where it will look as good on their phone as it will on their laptop.

I'm not sure how to go about dealing with names that are too big for their containers.
My username *wgpsutherland* currently extends off screen on my phone (not a good thing for showing this site off to people).

I feel for usernames I'm going to have the font size at the top smaller anyway (as why should a username be the most prominent thing on the page), but for module and grade titles I need to have a think.

I have a few options:

* I can restrict the length of a module or assignment (not good).
* I can increase the size of the boxes (not good as I think they're too big already).
* I can make the font size smaller. 
* I can have elipses replacing the rest of the text if the string gets too long.

I'm probably going to go with one of the last two.
