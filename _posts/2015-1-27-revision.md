title: Revision.
---

I didn't want to just write about how much I don't enjoy revising, so I left this blog to stew for a few weeks whilst I was doing my exams.
But it's all over tomorrow, so I feel like I can start writing again without feeling guilty!
(I really should have left this until tomorrow, but the day before an exam always makes me feel restless).

I keep coming up with new ideas for projects, and I can't wait to get started on them when this exam is out of the way.

Markov chains have been distracting me a lot recently.
I'm coming up with a fair few ideas on what I actually want to do with them, but I know building a text parser that calculates probabilities is a good first step.
I'm not even sure what language I want to do it in.
Python seems like a good choice, but Ruby is also tempting as we are about to start learning it at uni.
JavaScript is also tempting as it would be the fastest for me, though this is probably a good reason as to why I should write it in another language.
