title: I shouldn't ignore my main project.
---

I did some work on *Gradients* today, feels good to start improving it again.
It's so close to being releasable as 1.0, I should really stop ignoring it and just get the rest done.
It just needs a bit of polish, with error feedback and the ability to change information about a grade after you've added it to the database. Everything else I can add after I get more users playing with it.

I love the fact that Aaron constantly uses it, gives me some hope that there is some potential in it.

I'm starting to think big with it now.
I need to change the database schema slightly to accomodate for the fact that different years of a module have different assignments, I hadn't considered it before.
Once I've done that I can start getting other people to use it, although it would be best for me to get the admin page done before that.

I might introduce an easy way to import a CSV file so that adding information is even easier.

My parents keep talking about selling this to the University.
I should really work harder on it.

I'm also getting more solid ideas about what my game is going to be.
I just need to sit down and bash out some proper art for it, though pencil and paper might be the best intial route.
I keep getting frustrated trying to make pixels right off the bat, I should plan first.
