title: Dear Dissertation.
---

I've always believed that a disseration should be the pinnacle of your undergraduate degree, the culmination of all your learning and the work you should be most proud of.
I plan for this to be true, so I'm starting early. 

Keeping track of everything I do is not going to be easy, so I'm going to try and keep my progress updated here.

I'm currently installing various libraries onto my raspberry pi so that I can actually do something productive. Tonight after work I've managed to get SSH working as well ensuring that git is fully functional, so now just lies the tedious process of waiting for things to install. 

It's going to be interesting working on this little machine, hopefully I'll be able to get a smooth development process going. I haven't decided yet whether I need to code on my laptop or whether I can do it on the pi. I'm assuming laptop will be a lot more enjoyable. Hopefully I can soon get some video from the picamera in the correct format, and work on it from my laptop. Making this process as comfortable as possible is going to be vital in determining how much I enjoy this project.
