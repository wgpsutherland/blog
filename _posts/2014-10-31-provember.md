title: Remember, remember to code in Provember.
---

I've always found it easy to sit down and do University work as I know that I *have* to do it, the consequences are too great not to.
With those consequences comes an inner drive, which is hard to replicate for a personal project where there is no potential for a bad grade.
In order to combat this I have decided to set myself a challenge for the month of November.

The challenge is simple.
**I must commit to GitHub at least once a day for the entire month of November.**

My longest streak on GitHub so far is 7 days.
1 week. 

That is all I have managed in the past.

To be fair to myself, I only started actively committing to GitHub over the summer before my internship, so I have always been busy doing other programming work.
I am still very busy with University work (which does not go on GitHub), so I need to also make time for my personal stuff.
I plan on being very productive this month!

My current streak on GitHub is 7 days (partly due to this blog), and so in 1 month it will have hopefully risen to 37.

I will make a post on the 1st of December.
Hopefully it will be a tale of success, of how I managed my time successfully and was able to complete the challenge along with all of my Uni work.
I will still make a post if I fail however, so I'm hoping that I don't have to do that!

Wish me luck!
