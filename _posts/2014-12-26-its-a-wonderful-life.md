title: It's a Wonderful Life.
---

I just watched *It's a Wonderful Life* again.
What a brilliant film.

A film like this will never be released again, it's just not possible.
The mixture of black & white, old, pronounced accents and the feel of the film is completeley from another time.
I can see why it's my mum's favourite.

*Gradients* is done.

Well. 

*Done*. 

I still have a lot of features I want to add, and there are some neccessary database changes to implement, but the complete basic functionality is there.
I haven't looked into how much I'm going to need to change to allow for modules to have multiple years, and I also need to look into how I'm currently structuring which modules get listed.
I need to list the ones that are linked to the university the user is attending, and I'm pretty sure I'm not doing that.
But that is for another time, I'm not planning on sending this out to other institutions just yet!

I reckon both changes will just be an evening's work, so that's a change I'll save for after a day of revising.

I've also finished the *Prince of Persia* book.
Very inspiring.
The tone of the second half of the second book was very different from the rest, his whole life *changed*, just like that.
I know the booked covered a fair number of years, but it was startling how quickly his life became incredible - 
travlleing the world, living in Paris for a couple of years, having the freedom to go wherever he pleased and being treated like a god when he went back to his old life.
Something to aspire to eh?

I just can't wait for Chicago.
It really is the big time.
I'm moving to another country for 3 months, I can't quite believe it's happening.
This is the biggest thing I've ever done.
I'm not scared yet, it's way too far away.

I want my offer letter to come, it was meant to be here by Christmas.
