title: A new approach.
---

So I realise that I've neglected this blog. 
I intended to write a long post every week about a topic that interested me, or something.
I guess I wanted to provide enlightening content to the masses, enriching their lives with my well argued thoughts.

That wasn't a very realistic idea.

I guess I don't have the time, I spend too much time working to devote lengthy periods to research for a blog post, so I've decided to take a different approach.
I've recently been reading *Kareteka* by Jordan Mechner (the guy that created *Prince of Persia*).
The book is a collation of his diaries through the years 1982 to 1985 - short and simple posts that sometimes only last one paragraph, every few days.
This is the approach that I want to take.
I want to provide an insight into my life, especially as things are getting very exciting for me, and I want to keep it realistic enough that I will be able to follow through with it.

I think I'll just write about what has gone on that day, interesting things that have happened, and my thoughts on them.
It probably won't be very interesting, but I really want to write, and I want to make something lasting out of this.

Maybe in a few years I'll be successful enough that peope actually want to read what I say, and if not, at least I've got something to remind me of the good old days.

So I will be back. And I will follow up on the Provember challenge (which I did keep!).
