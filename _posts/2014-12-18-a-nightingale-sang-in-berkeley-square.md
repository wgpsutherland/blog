title: A Nightingale Sang In Berkeley Square.
---

I spent all of yesterday listening to John Williams, going into the early hours of this morning where I sit now.
It's as if Spotify knows what time it is - as it's gotten later it has started to play the score to *The Terminal*, a light, relaxing soundtrack that at one point alluded to *A Nightingale Sang In Berkeley Square*. 

It reminds me of Rod Stewart and home.

Haskell is driving me a little bit insane. 

It's not because it's hard or that I can't do it, it's just it's stopped me enjoying the last few days of University before I go home for Christmas.
I had to miss Uni Christmas Day, I'm having to work all of today. 
I just wish they hadn't set a deadline on the last day of term. 

I'm moaning.

But it's very cathartic.

I'm working on what I reckon is my last tactic for the program.
So many of these tactics have turned out to be useless that it's a little disheartening.
It's not that I've programmed them incorrectly, they just don't have a significant impact on the outcome of a game.
At least I can talk about this in my report. 

This final tactic though, I expect it to make a difference. It will essentially play a domino that does not give the opponent the oppurtunity to then score highly. It's going to be similar in complexity to the function that stops an opponent winning the game, but I hope it will have more of an impact as it won't be a last gasp tactic - it will be active throughout the game.
