title: A Nightingale Sang In Berkeley Square.
---

I spent all of yesterday listening to John Williams, going into the early hours of this morning where I sit now.
It's as if Spotify knows what time it is - as it's gotten later it has started to play the score to *The Terminal*, a light, relaxing soundtrack that at one point alluded to *A Nightingale Sang In Berkeley Square*. 

It reminds me of Rod Stewart and home.

Haskell is driving me a little bit insane. 

It's not because it's hard or that I can't do it, it's just it's stopped me enjoying the last few days of University before I go home for Christmas.
I had to miss Uni Christmas Day, I'm having to work all of today. 
I just wish they hadn't set a deadline on the last day of term. 

I'm moaning.

But it's very cathartic.

I'm working on what I reckon is my last tactic for the program.
So many of these tactics have turned out to be useless that it's a little disheartening.
It's not that I've programmed them incorrectly, they just don't have a significant impact on the outcome of a game.
At least I can talk about this in my report. 

This final tactic though, I expect it to make a difference. It will essentially play a domino that does not give the opponent the oppurtunity to then score highly. It's going to be similar in complexity to the function that stops an opponent winning the game, but I hope it will have more of an impact as it won't be a last gasp tactic - it will be active throughout the game.

I just redeemed a couple of iTunes vouchers I had lying around.
It gives you the option to hold up the card to your web cam and scan the code for you. 
Honestly, I've never been so impressed, it was instantaneous. The split second I held it up it read the card and added the money to my account.
I've only ever experienced these things take a few seconds before.

The future is now kids.

Rewatched the second *Hobbit* film today.
As much as I'm not a fan of the films as a whole, it is better than I thought it was when I left the cinema the first time. 
The barrell scene, though ridiculous, is very, very cool. 
They could have done without the shots that looked like they were filmed with a GoPro however. 

It is just so long.
I think that's the films downfall.
It goes on too long, with too much filler.
The good bits are great, but it should have been finised in two films.
I'm very interested to see the the third one now, my hopes are not high.

Do not even get me started on the CGI orcs.

I probably shouldn't have left my haskell designs until after I'd written them all.
Now I have to slog through all of them and show the control structure.
It's an effort, but there is no way I'm going to lose marks for something so simple. 
It's just time consuming, and I can handle that.
