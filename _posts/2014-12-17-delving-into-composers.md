title: Delving into composers.

So today I'm just going to listen through the music of John Williams.
A wonderful composer, it's so interesting to see how his approch to film scores is so different to someone like Hans Zimmer. 

To think one person created the theme tunes for 
*Harry Potter*, 
*Indiana Jones*, 
*Jaws*, 
*Star Wars* and
*Jurrassic Park* - 
not to mention all the others I haven't even listed - is humbling. 
I can't imagine pervading the general public like this, where your work is recognised and loved by generations.

I can just tell that this pursuit of mine is going to lead into listening to classical composers. 
If it works for Carmack and Mechner, it can work for me.

Reading through *Karateka* last night, Mechner alluded to a game mechanic that grabbed my attention. 
I'm unsure whether my interpretation of it is correct, and whether or not it is in the game as he only mentioned it in passing, but it could really add a sense of urgency and realism to a game.

In a game where there is a countdown, instead of having the timer appear on the screen so the player can always see it, the timer must be accessed by a player looking at their watch (or some sort of equivalent action). 
When busy engaging in a fight, a player will not know how much time they have left until they are able to dispactch the enemy for long enough to have a quick glance at their watch.
This creates a heightened sense of urgency, and is more akin to real life.
There could be the added mechanic of the game not letting the player know that time is up until they look at their watch. 
The player could forget, fighting through hordes of enemies futilely, when they are just too late.
It's very interesting.

I'm so incredibly distracted today - I'm going to Chicago!
I still can't quite believe it, hopefully it'll seem more real after my phone call with the California office on Monday. 
But Chicago!
This is a dream for me, going to America for 3 months to work doing what I love.
I can't wait.

I Google Streetviewed the office I should be working in, it's right next to the Millenium Park. 
And it's a highrise...
Bloody hell.
