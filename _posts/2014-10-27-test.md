This is a test post. Please ignore.

Some things are ok, but this lecture is not. It is pretty boring.

{% highlight ruby %}
def show
    @widget = Widget(params[:id])
    respond_to do |format|
        format.html # show.html.erb
        format.json { render json: @widget }
    end
end
{% endhighlight %}


<div class="snow-field"></div>
<br>

As you can see, this is amazing!
