title: Beautiful Pixels.
---

So Sony pulled *The Interview* from all distribution.
This is very interesting.
I want to know what emails the hackers have, 
I want to know if it really was NK who hacked Sony,
and I want Seth Rogan and James Franco to go down in history.

Hilarious.

I started playing *Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP* today.

It is beautiful.

I've had this game for *so* long, but I've never played it as I never saw the appeal. 
After the experience that was *Monument Valley* however, I'm craving beautiful games.
I saw *Sword* mentioned in a comment on a *Monument* thread about how people should try it, and that was all it took to make me give it a shot.

I am so inspired right now.

I need to make a pixel art game.
It just feels like the right thing to do, and it will test so many of my capabilities.
It would be the perfect learning oppurtunity, and the thought of making a finished product is so exciting.
It would have to be on iOS.

I have two games for inspiration now: *Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP* and *Monument Valley*. 
I have no other plans. 
Just from these two games I know that it will be simple in style, beautiful to look at, and follow a set path for the story.
It will definitely have puzzle elements, and will be played in episodes.

The rest I have no idea! 

I also need to play *Fez*.
It seems right up my street.

I just bought *Fez* for Â£1.75. 
Steam sales are killer.
