Gradients is looking so much better now, it's pretty much at the stage where I would be happy to show anyone that isn't a close friend of mine.
All it took was a few hours of escaping from my extended family for me to buckle down and do it.

The main improvements are the ability to change a grade and for their to be feedback on errors, but there are so many little things I've done that make it better.
I've been closing off the GitHub issues like nobodies business. 

Having the grades view be made up of tiles as opposed to a list is *so* much nicer, as well as cleaning up the actual information that gets shown to users.
The lists always grated on me, and I'm glad they're gone.

I just need to improve the appearance in some places and make the editGrades page look nicer before I think I'll set a milestone as v1.0.
This is quite a big deal!
I've left this project stagnating for too long, it's the most fleshed out thing I've ever created, and it deserves a bit more attention.

I'm going to find a few people in the year to test it out for me and let me know if they find any bugs, I'll gradually tell more people about it.
Maybe post on the year facebook group... Interested to see how it will go down there, no one seems to give a shit about anything unless it's to complain.

I'm still hugely frustrated with the *only* bug I can find in the project - reloading the editGrade page causes the data to not fetch and it shows as blank.
This doesn't happen with the other data addition pages, so I need to have a good crawl through the code to see what it may be. 
I can leave it in for the forseeable future, but it's annoying.
