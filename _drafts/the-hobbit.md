title: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, a comparison.
---


I recently went to see *The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies*, which is the final film in the *Hobbit* trilogy.

I have to admit that I only went to see film because I had seen the other two and I felt like it would be a waste to not see the concluding part.
I felt no urge to see it out of excitement or anticipation, which was a great contrast to how I felt when going to see *The Two Towers* and *The Return of the King*.

I guess I want to talk about what I feel went wrong with the *Hobbit* films, compared to the *LOTR* trilogy that preceded them.

#### Aesthetics
* use of colour
* use of cgi in the scenery
* use of cgi in the makeup
* design of the orcs
* "go pro" barell scene

#### Humour
* slapstick comedy

#### Realism
I understand that Middle Earth is not *our* Earth. 
Obviously, as we don't have magic.
It does still have its own rules though, which must be maintained to keep the film realistic within itself.
Even when set in a fantastical land that contains wizard and elves, if the film has previously shown what rules are in place within the universe, these rules *cannot* be broken.
If they are, the audience is taken out of the film and lose belief in it.
What I'm trying to say is that a film's universe must be consistent.

*The Lord of the Rings* set the rules for Middle Earth.
In the *Hobbit*, Legolas destroyed them.

* lack of realism within the LOTR universe
* invincible legolas

#### Uneccessarry love triangle

#### Grating fan service
* gimli son of gloin 
* not saying aragorn's name "you'll find that out yourself"

#### Filler
* radagast
* endless fight scene
* dragon goes on for about 4 hours

#### PJ not caring
* initially meant to be another director
