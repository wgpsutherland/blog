title: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, a comparison.
---

So I went to see *The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies*, the final film in the *Hobbit* trilogy.

I must admit I only went to see it because I had seen the other two, I felt no urge to see it out of excitement or anticipation.
This contrasts hugely to how I felt when going to see *The Two Towers* and the *Return of the King*.

I want to talk about where I think the new films went wrong, as well as what I think they did right.

#### Aesthetics
* use of colour
* use of cgi in the scenery
* use of cgi in the makeup
* design of the orcs
* "go pro" barell scene

#### Humour
* slapstick comedy

#### Realism
* lack of realism within the LOTR universe
* invincible legolas

#### Uneccessarry love triangle

#### Grating fan service
* gimli son of gloin 
* not saying aragorn's name "you'll find that out yourself"

#### Filler
* radagast
* endless fight scene
* dragon goes on for about 4 hours

#### PJ not caring
* initially meant to be another director
